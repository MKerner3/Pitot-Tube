5/16:
Reviewed Pitot Probe Physics.
Made Preliminary list of Parts for initial Pitot Probe.
Researched differences in ADC resolution and precision, which
will be a limiting factor at low and high airspeeds.
Researched different pressure transducers that work with
an arduino, and operating ranges
Found some pitot probe kits.

5/17
Determined wiring diagrams for pressure sensor and adc to arduino board.
Downloaded some software libraries for ADC interface and
example code for Pressure transducer.

5/19
Refreshed some python knowledge
Learned ways to signal process with python
Refreshed on filter types, fourier transforms
Learned how to apply a butterworth filter to a signal in python

5/20
Made a real time frequency reader
Can take in time data and sensor data and output it in a linked list data structure that updates with time
Started on researching how to plot the graph faster

5/22
Assembled Pitot Probe and ADS on wiring diagram
Configured Arduino to read pressure readings using tutorial code
Configured anaconda to work with arduino and read serial data

5/23
Updated code to reject empty values
Integrated ADS1256 into system, made pitot readings more accurate.

5/24
Cut extra Pitot Tube to see how it is built
Implemented first version of a Fourier transform in data reader
Found a way to use a tone generator to make an oscillating airspeed to test transform against

5/25
Tried fixing fourier transform, not much success
Looked into smaller steel tubes on mcmastercarr

5/26
Implemented working version of a fourier transform
Implemented preliminary butterworth filter

5/30
Made a CAD model of the pitot probe.
Researched plastic tubing links for the second iteration probe.

6/1
Started designing pitot tube mount. Mostly finished but needs a mount shell to close the mount and fit the tube with.

6/2
Designed mount shell and updated assembly to include mount shell.
Updated mount to have dowel holes and cable hole for the pressure sensor wires to be routed through.

6/5
Researched threading methods for 3d printed holes. Heat set inserts seemed to be the best method.
Polished mount parts to be ready for 3D printing. Made tolerance estimates and saved finalized STL files.

6/6
Sent in 3D print of mount into AMS.
Fixed Fourier transform accuracy issue.

6/7
Corrected Butterworth filter in test.py
Implemented fourier transform and butterworth filter from test.py into data_reader.py
Added python linting style checker
